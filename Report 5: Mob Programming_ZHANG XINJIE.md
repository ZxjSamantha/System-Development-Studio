# Report 5: Mob Programming
## Name: ZHANG XINJIE Student ID Number: 20M14457

I had a fun time when doing mob programming with other team members, though I think I did not do very well when I was a navigator because of my poor Japanese (Languagae ability may be considered as a key factor). We finally finished this task and the code of our work is put in the directory `100doors`. In remote operations, the **simultaneously sharing of code** and **save of the code** can be very important. 

I think 100 doors is a relatively simple problem, so team members don't need much preliminary knowledges in this task. In the difficult tasks, it could be good if every member shares a similar level of knowledge and background. 

In my experience of mob programming, I think it is really fun and relieved because the driver is always supported by navigators, and navigators are supporting each other. However, I think the one of the limitations of the mob programming maybe it is not suitable for large-scale development.
