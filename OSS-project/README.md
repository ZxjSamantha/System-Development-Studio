This is the OSS project created by ZxjSamantha on Statistical Theories of Brain and Parallel Computing. 

This project includes the following parts (to be continued):

1.  Probabilistic and binary model.
2.  Deterministic Binary Neuron model. 
3.  Weights converter using Gibbs sampling
4.  Construction of a single RNN 
5.  Find connection weights (thresholds) for Four-Queen Problem (N-Queen probelm)
6.  Solve Traveling Salesman problem using RNN with probabilistic updating rule.
7.  Use step (0)~(5) to train the RNN and make it approximate a given table.
