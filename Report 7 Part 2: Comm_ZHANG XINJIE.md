# Report 7 Part 2: Communication

Exercise 1: Give an example of a problem of the current status of management of university or laboratory.

In this exercise, I joined group 1 and our group member chose the topic "How to increase the number of international students in the circle clubs in the university?". I really appreciate others' support and understanding even my Japanese is not so fluent. Because we had two international students in this group, we chose the topic about international students. I think I can feel respect and trust from other members just like Sensei mentioned that what is important for communication. 

I think we may not did a good discussion that figure out the "Current status", "Expectation" and "Gap between current status and expectation" on this topic, but I still had much fun in discussion (I hope others can feel it as well). What I think is really important for communication is **honesty**. Especailly in technical problems, the specific and exact facts are the basis of discussion and trust. I also think the way of communication "Yes, and..." instead of "But..." is much better because it conveys a willing to communicate instead of winning in the debate (Though debate may be not avoided).

Exercise 2: Review 3Q with YWT method. 

Many thanks to Uchida-sensei and all classmates in this class, though we have not met each other. 

**I think this is the best lecture I have taken in 3Q**. I think I am a beginner to programming though I have done some machine learning projects, but there are still so much fun that I have not explored and I am excited about what I can learn and use from now. What I really enjoy is that programmers are always glad to share what they have found and explore what they have not found.
